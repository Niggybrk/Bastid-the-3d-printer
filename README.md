There's not much here, really. Just trying to set up the firmware for my home-made 3-d printer.

Please note I am not very bright so any help offered will be gladly accepted.

My first question to ponder is whether or not Linux running on my PC will be suitable.
Software. Is there a full suite of Linux-based software to do this?


Build_plate size 325*325  Height = 300mm
24Volt system.
Frame = 2040 & 2020  aluminium extrusion.
Motherboard = Btt SKR Mini E3 V3.0
Screen TFT35 4"*3"

Any help offered will be gladly received. 

Thanks for reading this.
